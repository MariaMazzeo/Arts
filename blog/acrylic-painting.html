    <h1>Acrylic Painting</h1>
   
  
    <p>Acrylics colors are versatile and dry fast. You can use them in an astonishing number of ways!.</p>
  
    <p>Acrylic paints are a great medium for beginners looking to get into painting. They are simple to use (once you get
    familiar with the quick drying times) and are much easier to clean up than oil paints.</p>
  
    <div class="tip tip-right">

    <p> The general painting principles are the same across all mediums. The main difference is the techniques used. Once you
    learn one medium at a competent level, you will find it easier and faster to pick up another medium.</p>
    <p>It seems acrylic painting has a bit of a bad stigma in that people believe it is less prestigious than oil
    painting. This is due to the fact all the masters painted mostly in oils. But do not be fooled by this. Acrylic painting
    has come a long way and is a fantastic medium. There are many amazing artists who focus solely on acrylic painting.</p>

  <h3>Be Decisive With Your Strokes</h3>
  <p>Unlike oil painting, you only have a limited amount of time that the paint will be wet and responsive on your canvas.

      <p>"color mixing is one of the most defining aspects of painting."</p>

    <h4>Mixing Your Colors</h4>

    <p>Before you place brush to canvas, be as certain as you can about the color. Use your palette for mixing and
    experimenting with colors, not your canvas. Unlike oil paints, you do not have the time to play around with the paint on
    the canvas as it will dry extremely fast.</p>
  
  
    <h3>Acrylic Paint Tends To Darken As It Dries</h3>
    <p>This is a common issue you will find with most acrylic paints - some colors will tend to darken as they dry. When mixing your colors, you should allow for a slight darkening. This effect seems to be more apparent in the lighter
    colors than the colors which are already dark.</p> 
    
    
    <h4>Use Artist Quality Materials</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The label to look for is ‘Artist Quality’, not ‘Student Quality’."</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Whilst you may be limited by a budget, if you invest in high-quality materials you will end up saving money over the
    long run. They will not deteriorate and your finished artworks will be of a much higher quality. If you are looking at
    selling your art, then this is a must.</p> 
    <p>Now if you are restricted by a budget, then I would invest first in top quality paint brushes. Then anything left over I
    would use for artist quality paints and canvas. To save money on paint, I would suggest you learn how to paint with a
    very limited palette - red, blue, yellow, white and burnt umber.</p>

    <h4>Stain Your Canvas</h4>
    <p>It is much easier to paint on a stained canvas than a glaring white canvas. The stain should be a very toned color - you do
    not want a stain which is too strong and vibrant.</p>
    <p>The stained canvas will help you judge the values and tones in your painting. It will also make it easier for you to
    paint your dark values on the canvas (it can be very difficult painting the dark areas in your painting directly on a
    white canvas).</p>

    <h3>Upsize Your Brush</h3>
    <p>Using large brushes does a few things - it increases your brushwork economy, makes you actually think about your strokes
    and makes it easier to cover a canvas.</p>
    <p>Many beginner artists are of the opinion smaller brushes will lead to more realistic and delicate painting. However,
    even the great master realism painters generally painted with brushes much larger than you would expect.
