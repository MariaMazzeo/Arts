    <h2>Color Theory For Artists</h2>
  
    <p>Color theory will help you understand the relationship between colors and how we perceive them.</p>
  
    <p>Color theory is one of the most fundamental areas of painting. The importance of understanding color theory far exceeds
    simply knowing how to mix colors together (for example, knowing that yellow and blue make green).

    <p>As an artist, you do not need to worry yourself about all the complex underlying principles of color theory. Rather, all
    you need to understand is the general application of color theory and the relationship between colors.</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Color theory is a fundamental base of understanding</p> 
      <p>for artists and should not be ignored."</p>
    </blockquote>
  
    <p>Using the primary colors, you could mix pretty much any color in the spectrum. This is why a solid knowledge of color
    theory is so important when it comes to painting and mixing your colors. This is also why you should always at a very
    least have the primary colors on your palette.</p>

  <h3>Color Theory Terms</h3>
  <p>HUE</p>
  <p>The term “hue” is often used as a simile for the term color. Hue generally refers to the dominant wavelength of color
  out of the twelve colors on the color wheel (being the primary, secondary and tertiary colors).</p>
  <p>SATURATION</p>
  <p>Saturation is a measure of how pure a color is. You can reduce the saturation of a color by adding gray or a color on
    the opposite side of the color wheel (which essentially kills the color).</p>
  <p>TONE</p>
  <p>Tone is a broad term used to describe a color which is not a pure hue and is not black or white. In many cases, artists
  use tone to describe a color which has been grayed down (de-saturated).</p>
  <p>VALUE</p>
  <p>Value is how light or dark the color is, on a scale of black to white. Value is widely considered to be one of the most
  important variables to the success of a painting.</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>"We can use these psychological triggers to influence </p>
       <p> how we want the viewer to perceive the painting."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"If you want the viewer to have a passionate and aggressive response, then you should be utilizing reds and other warm
    colors. If you want a calming scene, then greens and blues should be utilized." </p>

    <h4>The Psychology Of Color Theory</h4>
    <p>Color has a powerful influence over human behaviour, to the extent it can manipulate your perception of what is actually
    there.</p>
  
    <p>Here are some colors and their emotional influences:</p>
  
    <p>RED: Passion, love, anger and danger</p>

    <p>ORANGE: Vitality, creativity and activity</p> 
    
    <p>YELLOW: Energy, light and hope</p> 
    
    <p>GREEN: Health, nature and wealth</p>
    
    <p>BLUE: Trust, security and spirituality</p> 
    
    <p>PURPLE: Creativity, royalty and wealth</p>

    <h4>Learning Color Theory As An Artist</h4>
  
  
    <p>Color theory can be incredibly complex, however for artists you only need to understand the general fundamentals of
    color theory. </p>
    <p>The best way to learn color theory is to purchase a color wheel or better yet, make your own using your
    own paints.</p>
