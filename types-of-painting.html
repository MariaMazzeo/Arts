  <h3>Oil painting</h3>
  <p>Oil painting is suitable for almost all kinds of styles.</p>

  <p>Oil paint uses some drying oil as a binder to the pigments, which gives the wonderful buttery feel to the paint. The
most common drying oils used as a binder are walnut oil, linseed oil, poppy seed oil and many more.</p>
  
  <p>Oil painting was first used by Indian and Chinese artists in the 5th century, but it became popular only in the 15th
century.</p>

    <h4>Watercolor painting</h4>
    <p>Watercolor painting is usually done on the paper. In this particuar type of painting, one uses water based solutions to
    mix the colors and hence the name water color painting.</p>
  
    <p>Compared to oil painting, watercolor painting is also similarly tough task. Nowadays you have plenty of artists trying
    out realistic looking portraits using watercolors. The mixing of colors is very crucial in this, since too much of
    anything, changes the shade of the colors.</p>
  
    <h3>Pastel painting</h3>

    <p>Pastel sticks are normally used to create the pastel paintings.</p> 
    
    <p>Using pastel sticks you can immediately start drawing and coloring, it uses the same binding pigments, except pastel
    sticks are a powder form which are bound together using a binding agent, and they are readymade. If you are looking for
    pure and deep colors, then it's highly recommended to use the pastel sticks. Pastel paintings can be done on canvas, so
    you can do beautiful layering of colors with pastels.</p> 
    
    <h4>Acrylic painting</h4>
    
    <p>If you are looking for faster drying painting, then acrylic painting is the best.</p> 
    <p>These are water soluble paints, yet once the painting is complete, it turns water resistant. Interesting fact isnt't it?
    Most hobbyists love to work with acrylic paints. For sculptures, moulding, facial features, many artists use acrylic
    painting. It is easier to clean the brushes after ise, since acrylic paints need only water to wash them off.</p>
    
    <h4>Digital painting</h4>
    <p>Digital painting is the art of creating artwork on a computer, which makes it resemble a watercolor painting, oil
    painting or even an acrylic painting.</p>
    <p>A digitally prepared oil painting and manually done oil painting will have plenty of differences, since you have access
    to plenty of other textures and instruments which are easily available on the system. Yes, you don't have to worry about
    paint spills a standing for long hours. You can do the same art in a relaxed manner, at the comfort of your homes.</p>

    <h4>Texture painting - Texture to Paint</h4>
  
  
    <p>Texture paintings are mostly used with oil paints, since while working with acrylic paints, they effects are lost when
    the acrylics dry up. But oil paints tend to be expensive, so as a substitute one can use acrylic impasto which works
    amazing on textures. Apart from regular paint brushes, flat knifes, blunt objects are used to create texture paintings.</p>
