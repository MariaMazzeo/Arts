    <h1>Oil Painting</h1>
   
  
    <p>Here are some of the best oil painting techniques to learn if you are a beginner and want to learn more about oil
    painting.</p>
  
    <p>There are some "rules" you need to be aware of and the techniques can take some time to become familiar with.</p>

    <p> Why would you use oil paints over some of the other alternatives like acrylics or watercolors?</p>
    <p>They are versatile. You can vary the drying time and consistency of your paint dramatically using paint thinners and
    additional oil. This allows you to work with a wide range of painting techniques, including blending, glazing and
    scumbling.
    They were favored by the all-time greats of painting. It is hard to argue the downside of using oil paints when so many
    amazing artists used them to such success.
    Oil paintings seem to be held in higher regard by art collectors compared to acrylic paintings (there are some
    exceptions to this of course).</p>

  <h3>Oil Painting Rules</h3>
  <p>Fat over lean: As noted earlier, oil paint is basically colored pigment which is held together by some kind of drying
oil. The more oil present, the "fatter" the paint is and the slower it will dry. In general, you want to make sure the
top layers of paint are fatter (or oiler) than the lower layers. Otherwise, the layers on top will dry faster than the
layers below and the paint will crack.</p>

  <p>Thick over thin: The reasoning behind this rule is the same as the above rule. You want to make sure the paint at the
top dries slower than the paint at the bottom. Thick paint will usually dry slower than thin paint.</p>
  
  <p>TIP: Visible brushwork is a fantastic element of painting, but it is often overlooked by beginners. Below is a close-up
of one of my paintings which demonstrates visible brushwork. This kind of visible brushwork is only possible when you
use a brush loaded with thick paint.</p>

    <h4>Oil Painting Technique - Scumbling</h4>

    <p>Scumbling is a dry-brush technique where little or no additional medium is used. Scumbling is different to glazing in
    that you do not want a smooth application of paint over the entire surface. You want a broken application of paint which
    leaves areas exposed.</p>
  
    <p>This technique can be perfect for creating an atmospheric depth in your paintings.</p>
  
    <h3>Oil Painting Technique - Alla Prima</h3>
    <p>This technique differs from the more traditional method of painting layer on layer, allowing the paint to dry in between
    each layer. Artists would often build up many layers (sometimes over 50) before deeming the painting complete.
    Obviously, this was a very time-consuming method of painting, as oil paint can take anywhere from a few days to some
    months before being completely dry.</p> 
    
    <p>Alla prima painting was practiced by many of the impressionist masters, as it allowed them to capture the elusive light
    as quickly as possible.
    Some of the famous artists who painted alla prima were John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh and Joaqu√≠n
    Sorolla.</p> 
    
    <h4>Oil Painting Technique - Glazing</h4>
    
    <p>A glaze is a thin, semi-transparent layer of paint. Glazing is a popular technique in oil painting, where glazes are
    applied on top of an opaque layer of paint which has been allowed to dry.</p> 
    <p>The general practice is to create a monochrome underpainting using opaque colors and then gradually build up glazes on
    top, allowing each layer to dry in-between. This practice is obviously very time consuming due to the slow drying time
    of oil paint. Depending on how many glazes are used, the time it takes to create an oil painting using this method could
    be anywhere from a few weeks to years.</p>
    <p>Many painters use both thin glazes and thick, impasto brushwork to create a variance in the painting. The impasto areas
    would appear pushed forward in the painting compared to the softer glazes.</p>

    <h4>Oil Painting Technique - Chiaroscuro</h4>
    <p>Chiaroscuro is Italian for "light dark". In drawing and painting, it refers to the balance and structure of light and
    dark in the artwork. </p>
    <p>Chiaroscuro originated from the Renaissance period where artists would create strong contrasts between light and dark to
    render three-dimensional forms to dramatic effect. Generally, chiaroscuro is only mentioned of artworks with a dominant
    contrast between light and dark.</p>
    <p>Caravaggio went on to become a figurehead in the Tenebrism art movement, where chiaroscuro was used to dramatic effect
    with violent contrasts between light and dark with a spotlight effect.</p>

    <h3>Oil Painting Technique - Impasto</h3>
    <p>Impasto is generally used in reference to paint which is applied in a thick and bold fashion with clearly visible
    brushwork, but it can also refer to the more subtle textures created by delicate brushwork on a more smooth surface.</p>
    <p>By using an impasto technique you can add another dimension to your painting by adding increased texture to areas of
    significance. This can enhance the illusion of three-dimensional representation.</p>
    <p>One artist who is famous for using a very impasto technique is Vincent van Gogh. His brushwork was extremely dominant in
    his paintings and a real signature of his work. His brushwork gives a sense of activity and movement in his paintings.</p>

    <h3>Oil Painting Technique - Grisaille</h3>
    <p>Grisaille is a monochrome painting executed entirely in different shades of gray or a grayish tone.</p>
    <p>'Gris' is a French term for gray. Paintings in a brown scale are referred to as brunaille and paintings in a green scale
    are referred to as verdaille.</p>
    <p>Grisaille was typically used during the Renaissance period as a stand-alone painting technique to imitate sculpture. It
    can also be used as a preliminary painting stage, where the grisaille forms an underpainting which can then be glazed
    over.</p>
  
    <h3>Oil Painting Technique - Blending</h3>
    <p>Blending is a painting technique where two different colors are slightly mixed together when wet, giving a smooth
    transition from one color to the next. The transition color will be a product of the two blended colors (i.e if you are
    blending blue into a yellow, the transition color will be a green).</p>
    <p>Blending requires the paint to be wet, which is a problem when painting with acrylics as the paint tends to dry
    extremely fast. The blending technique is much more popular with oil painting, as the paint stays wet and versatile for
    much longer.</p>
    <p>Blending is probably one of the most overused techniques by beginner painters, as they aim to create a very smooth and
    'realistic' painting. However, too much blending can easily result in the painting having a very plastic and
    overly-refined appearance.</p>

    <h3>Oil Painting Technique - Oiling Out</h3>
    <p>Oiling out is a technique used in oil painting when the oil sinks into the lower layers of a painting, leaving the top
    layers lacking vitality.</p>
    <p>Often sinking occurs in patches, rather than over the whole painting due to varied drying times of the paints used (some
    colors dry faster than others).</p>
    <p>Oiling out is not a technique which beginners should be worried about. It is more of an advanced technique and is not a
    necessary part of learning how to paint. It is however, a useful technique once one becomes more advanced with oils.</p>
