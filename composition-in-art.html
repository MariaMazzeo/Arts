    <h2>Composition in Art</h2>
   
  
    <p>A well composed painting intrigue and invite the viewer and help communicate the artist's statement.</p>
  
    <p>Composition in art is essentially the arrangement of visual elements using various principles and techniques. It is
    often used to describe the overall design of a painting.</p>

    <p>Composition involves arranging the visual elements with guidance of the principles of art to promote the artist's
    statement. Unity is achieved when the artist's statement is aligned with the composition.</p>

  <h3>The principles of art are:</h3>
  <p>RHYTHM: Creating a visual tempo through the use of repetitive elements.</p>

  <p>BALANCE: The arrangement of elements to create a feeling of balance and stability in your painting.</p>
  
  <p>EMPHASIS: The arrangement of elements to place emphasis on desired areas in your painting.</p>

  <p>GRADATION: A gradual change in a certain element to help connect the composition (long lines to short lines, large
 shapes to small shapes, dark to light tones, etc).</p>
  
  <p>HARMONY: Using similar elements throughout your painting to create a general sense of harmony.</p>

<p>VARIETY: Using different elements to create interest and contrast.</p>

<p>MOVEMENT: Creating a visual sense of movement in your painting through the placement of elements (for example, short,
bold strokes in a painting would give the indication of movement and activity when used in contrast to long and muted
strokes).</p>

<p>PROPORTION: The relative size of one element in comparison to another.</p>

    <h4>Rule of odds</h4>
    <p>The “rule of odds” suggests that an odd number of subjects in an image is more interesting than an even number.</p>
  
    <p>An image of a person surrounded / framed by two other persons, for instance, where the person in the center is the
    object of interest in that artwork, is more likely to be perceived as friendly and comforting by the viewer, than an
    image of a single person with no significant surroundings.</p>
  
    <h3>Simplification</h3>

    <p>Simplification is one of the most important skills you can learn as an artist. The master painter's used simplification
    to reduce the clutter in their artworks and enhance the focal points.</p> 
    
    <p>Simplification is most effective when combined with targeted complexity. This can be a powerful combination which you
    can use to really emphasise areas in your painting.</p> 
    
    <h4>Rule of thirds</h4>
    
    <p>The rule of thirds is a technique used to ensure the focal point of your painting is not directly in the center and that
    your painting is not overly symmetrical. What it entails is cutting the scene into thirds both ways. You will end up
    with nine sections. The aim is to place your focal point at one of the intersections and to ensure none of your sections
    are the same. In general, a focal point which is directly in the center of the painting is not visually appealing for
    the viewer as it bisects the painting and appears unnatural.</p>

    <h4>Rules Exist To Be Broken</h4>
  
  
    <p>You will hear many 'rules' which are touted for creating an interesting composition. However you should not consider
    these as rules you must strictly follow. Instead, you should think of these rules as rough guidelines or suggestions to
    aid your decision making process. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"For every 'rule' there are many brilliant paintings which have broken it!"</p>
