    <h1>Watercolor Painting</h1>
   
  
    <p>If you can master the tricky medium, then you will be able to create some of the most stunning pieces.</p>

    <p> Watercolor painting is generally considered to be the most difficult medium to learn, as you are not able to easily correct errors and
    due to the uncontrolled nature of water.</p>

  <h3>Be careful, but not tight</h3>
  <p>If you make a mistake in watercolor painting, it is often not an easy fix. A mistake made is a mistake stayed
    unfortunately.</p>

<p>You need to be willing to accept that mistakes will happen in watercolor painting. Otherwise you will paint far too
reluctantly. This will not come easily when you start out with watercolors. You will either paint loose but with many
mistakes, or tight with… probably still many mistakes.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Many of the great watercolor paintings seem to be a hybrid of </p>
        <p>loose and delicate brushwork, which compliment each other nicely."</p>

    <h4>Use masking fluid to preserve your whites</h4>

    <p>You can use masking fluid to cover areas of white paper which you do not want to be hit by paint. This is perfect for
    doing washes of color whilst keeping areas of paper protected from the paint.</p>
    
  
    <h3>Make corrections using the lifting technique</h3>
    <p>By using the lifting technique, you can ‘lift’ some of the water and paint from the paper. For example, say you placed
    down too much green in the trees. You can use the lifting technique to remove some of that color and then make any
    necessary adjustments.</p> 
    
    
    <h4>Use a hair dryer</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"You will not be able to completely fix any mistakes, </p>
        <p> but you will be able to mitigate the damage."</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>There is no need to wait for the paint to dry on your paper before continuing. You can use a hair dryer to speed-up the
    drying time of the paint. You can even use a hair dryer to just speed-up the drying time of small portions of your
    painting and leave the rest of the painting wet.</p>

    <h4>Splatter your paint</h4>
    <p>A great watercolor painting technique is to splatter paint onto the paper. This creates a very interesting effect which
    can be perfect for landscapes to depict grass and trees, or just to create some variance in your painting.</p>
    <p>All you need to do is load your brush with paint and water and pull the bristles back with your fingers. Then release
    the bristles and let the paint ‘splatter’ onto the canvas.</p>

    <h3>Use artist quality watercolor materials</h3>
    <p>f you are just starting out, then there is nothing wrong with using cheap art materials. However, there is a noticeable
    difference between the high quality and cheap materials.</p>
    <p>So when you are more developed (or just if you have the budget), I recommend you invest in some high-quality brushes,
    paints and paper to use. You should immediately feel the difference.</p>
